# blurry-loading
The JS for this project has simultaneous action. While the image is loading, it goes from blurred to clear. At the same time the percentage goes from 0 to 100 while fading out. This uses a pure JS function to map a range of numbers to have a number on screen go fully opaque to fade out.
